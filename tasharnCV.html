            <h2>Interests</h2>

            <p>
                I enjoy creating 3D scenes using the 3D animation and modelling tool, Blender.
                My introduction to Blender resulted in me gaining an interest in animation both 3D and 2D animation.
                A few months after my initial introduction to Blender, I worked on a short animated video as part of a
                team for the animation competition, Animation12. The video ended up getting an award and can be viewed
                here:

            <p>
                Months after this, I also worked with a team at 3Dami 2012 to produce
                this short animated video: http://youtu.be/_l34KV8Px3o.

            <p>
                I also enjoy playing multiple different genres
                of music on my acoustic guitar and I like reading any type of fiction although I do not currently have
                a favourite author.
