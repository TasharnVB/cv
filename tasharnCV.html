                <p>
                I am a recent BSc (Hons) Computer Science graduate who has achieved a 2:1 degree.
                I can pick up new ideas and concepts very quickly which has been an invaluable skill in past years.
                I have organisational and time management skills, which I have successfully used and improved during my studies at university.
                I enjoy problem solving and constantly exhibited my problem solving abilities while doing my university courses.
                I have also facilitated in the creation and publication of two animation films on YouTube, one of which resulted in receiving an award.

                <h2>Interests</h2>

                <p>
                    I enjoy creating 3D scenes using the 3D animation and modelling tool, Blender.
                    My introduction to Blender resulted in me gaining an interest in animation both 3D and 2D animation.
                    A few months after my initial introduction to Blender, I worked on a short animated video as part of a
                    team for the animation competition, Animation12. The video ended up getting an award and can be viewed
                    here:

                <p>
                    Months after this, I also worked with a team at 3Dami 2012 to produce
                    this short animated video:

                <p>
                    I also enjoy playing multiple different genres
                    of music on my acoustic guitar and I like reading any type of fiction although I do not currently have
                    a favourite author.
