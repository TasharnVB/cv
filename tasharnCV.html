			<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

			<p>
			I am a recent BSc (Hons) Computer Science graduate who has achieved a 2:1 degree.
			I can pick up new ideas and concepts very quickly which has been an invaluable skill in past years.
			I have organisational and time management skills, which I have successfully used and improved during my studies at university.
			I enjoy problem solving and constantly exhibited my problem solving abilities while doing my university courses.
			I have also facilitated in the creation and publication of two animation films on YouTube, one of which resulted in receiving an award.
